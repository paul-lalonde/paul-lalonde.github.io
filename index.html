<h1>TL;DR: Telus is exposing its former users to identity theft.</h1>
<p>A few days ago I made a disconcerting discovery.  A revived email thread from a few years ago garnered a response from someone using ****@telus.net who wasn't me - on the old email address I had when I was a Telus home internet customer in the late 90s and early 2000s.  Telus had reassigned the "unused" email address to the next person to request it.
<p>
This is very bad.  I immediately tracked down a couple of important accounts (including my AppleID) that were still linked to this email address - it's very incovenient/difficult to dissociate some accounts from the handle you used when you first signed up.  Worse, I can't get a password reset, since they go to that old email address, and can't even delete the account without that login. I'm lucky, the new owner of my former address doesn't appear to be a sociopath. 
<p>
Telus, however, is a corporation, and thus a sociopath.  I tweeted them for support, since I know this email address re-use is very much against basic security/privacy policy.  They were kind enough to escalate for me, at each stage reaffirming that their use was within their policy and terms of service (though not, perhaps the terms from when I was a customer). Today I reached the top-of-line "Nothing will be done" escalation manager.
<p>
Telus has *chosen* to expose its former customers to identity theft, and refuses to re-examine their policy.  This is a company that is trying to make us believe that their Telus Health subsidiary should be trusted with personal medical records.</p>
